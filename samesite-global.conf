# 1. Add SameSite=None and Secure if no SameSite already.
Header always edit Set-Cookie "^(?!.*(\s+|;)(?i)SameSite=)(.*)" "$0; SameSite=None; Secure" env=!SAMESITE_SKIP
Header onsuccess edit Set-Cookie "^(?!.*(\s+|;)(?i)SameSite=)(.*)" "$0; SameSite=None; Secure" env=!SAMESITE_SKIP
# 2. Remove duplicate SECURE flag (this keeps the above regex simpler)
Header always edit Set-Cookie "(.*(\s+|;)(?i)Secure(\s+|;).*) Secure$" "$1" env=!SAMESITE_SKIP
Header onsuccess edit Set-Cookie "(.*(\s+|;)(?i)Secure(\s+|;).*) Secure$" "$1" env=!SAMESITE_SKIP

# Why the duplication?  always is not a superset of onsuccess the way it should be.

## More complex examples that can replace step 1 above:
# Example of excluding a specific Set-Cookie cookie-name:
#   Header always edit Set-Cookie "^(?!.*(\s+|;)(?i)SameSite=)((?!SpecialCookie).*)" "$0; SameSite=None; Secure" env=!SAMESITE_SKIP
#   Header onsuccess edit Set-Cookie "^(?!.*(\s+|;)(?i)SameSite=)((?!SpecialCookie).*)" "$0; SameSite=None; Secure" env=!SAMESITE_SKIP
# Example of including [only] a specific Set-Cookie cookie-name:
#   Header always edit Set-Cookie "^(?!.*(\s+|;)(?i)SameSite=)((?=SpecialCookie).*)" "$0; SameSite=None; Secure" env=!SAMESITE_SKIP
#   Header onsuccess edit Set-Cookie "^(?!.*(\s+|;)(?i)SameSite=)((?=SpecialCookie).*)" "$0; SameSite=None; Secure" env=!SAMESITE_SKIP
